Based on the dataset provided on the hackathon organized by [Cerebro, SDS Labs](https://cerebro.sdslabs.co/) (IITR Data Science Portal). The dataset comprises of over 1000 features and 1000 data entries with a target variable 'Status' with value either 0,1 or 2 correspondings to COVID 19 infection, Viral Pnueomonia or Healthy. We utilised a Deep Neural Network to obtain a validation accuracy of 0.94.
